# Project Brief

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name:** Digital Signboard App
**Type:** Digital Signage Application
**Architecture:** Next.js + Agility CMS

## 📋 Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Build a signboard app that displays content from Agility CMS
- [ ] Each Agility CMS "page" represents a different sign
- [ ] Each sign displays as a web page with 1+ components
- [ ] Content editors can update signs via Agility CMS without code changes

### Success Metrics
- Content updates reflect on signs within [X] minutes
- Signs load and display correctly on digital displays
- Easy content management workflow for non-technical users

## 📱 Platform Requirements

### Display Devices
- [x] Digital Signage Displays (Primary)
- [ ] Tablets (if needed for preview)
- [ ] Desktop browsers (for preview/editing)

### Browsers
- [x] Chrome (latest) - Primary for digital displays
- [x] Edge (latest) - Alternative
- [ ] Safari (for preview/testing)

### Display Characteristics
- Full-screen display mode
- Landscape orientation (typical)
- High resolution support
- Auto-refresh capability (if needed)

## 🔑 Key Features

### Must-Have Features
1. Dynamic page routing - Each Agility CMS page = one sign URL
2. Component-based display - Signs built from reusable components
3. Real-time content updates - Changes in CMS reflect on signs
4. Full-screen display mode - Optimized for digital signage

### Nice-to-Have Features
1. Auto-refresh/rotation between signs
2. Scheduled content display
3. Preview mode for content editors

## 🚫 Constraints & Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- Content must come from Agility CMS
- Must work on standard web browsers (digital display devices)
- Full-screen display required

### Display Constraints
- Fixed aspect ratios (typically 16:9 or 4:3)
- No user interaction (view-only)
- Must be readable from distance

## 📊 Assumptions

1. Digital displays run standard web browsers
2. Network connectivity available for content updates
3. Content editors have access to Agility CMS
4. Signs are primarily text/image based (no complex interactions)
